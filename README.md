## üóÇÔ∏è Project Workflow (Data Pipeline)

1.  **Data Collection:** Utilized the public Olist dataset, which consists of 9 separate CSV files.
2.  **Data Transformation & Modeling:**
    * Merged 5 key tables (orders, order\_items, products, customers, payments) into a single master table using **Python (Pandas)**.
    * Cleaned the data by handling null values (`NaN`) and converting date columns to the proper datetime format.
    * Performed feature engineering to create new, insightful columns such as `delivery_duration` and `purchase_month`.
3.  **Data Loading:** Exported the cleaned and enriched DataFrame to **Google Sheets**, which serves as the Data Mart for this project.
4.  **Data Visualization:** Connected Google Sheets to **Looker Studio** to build a multi-page interactive dashboard.
